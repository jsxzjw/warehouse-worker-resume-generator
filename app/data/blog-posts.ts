    content: `# Warehouse Worker Resume Examples That Pass ATS

Creating a warehouse worker resume that passes ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) is crucial in today's competitive job market. Many large companies, including Amazon, use ATS to filter resumes before a human ever sees them.

## Key ATS Optimization Strategies

### 1. Keyword Optimization

Carefully review the job description and include exact terms like:
- Inventory management
- Forklift operation
- Shipping and receiving
- Safety compliance

### 2. Standard Section Headings

Use standard section headings such as:

ATS can misread creative headings.

Include quantifiable results:
- "Managed a warehouse inventory of over 5,000 units with 99% accuracy"
- "Processed 500+ orders daily with zero discrepancies"
- "Reduced shipping errors by 15% through improved inventory tracking"

### 4. Clean Formatting

- Avoid graphics, tables, and excessive formatting
- Keep bullet points concise
- Start each with strong action verbs: operated, managed, coordinated, monitored

## Final Tips

Always tailor your resume for each application, ensuring that relevant skills and experiences are highlighted to match the job description. By following these practices, your warehouse worker resume will stand out both to ATS and hiring managers, significantly improving your chances of landing interviews.
